# How to contribute?

## Pull requests

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch for each feature or improvement.
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch.

It is very important to separate new features
or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a pull request for each branch.
This allows me to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.

## Style guide

All pull requests should adhere to the [PSR-2 standard](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/).

## Unit testing

All pull requests should be accompanied by passing unit tests and complete code coverage.
This library uses [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) for testing.

**Happy coding**!
